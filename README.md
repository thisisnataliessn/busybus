Questions 2018-9-24 afternoon
1. Why can't I get my `leaving-time` class to have the text justified on the right? (I'd add a margin so it wouldn't reach the end of the page of course)
2. Why doesn't the `justify-content` property work for my `back`, `recents`, and `leaving-time` classes?
3. Why doesn't the `bottom-navbar` start right below the `main` element (which I moved up to cover part of the map)?
