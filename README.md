# busybus
Questions from 2018-9-24:
Do I need to sort my stops by eastbound, westbound, etc?
How to get my time-icon and back arrow to images show up? (I tried `background-image` property in CSS)
How to get `bus-line`, `destination`, and `leaving-time` to display inline? (I tried `display:inline-block` for the `line-entry` class)
Why won’t the `height` property for `nav` work? And also, why won’t it take the #248FB2 background color that I currently have behind `h2.page-title`?
